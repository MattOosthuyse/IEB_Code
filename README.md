# IEB_Code

All programs written in the YouTube videos and more.

# Repo Structure

The purpose of this repo is to make code I have written accessible to students that take IEB (JAVA).

## class_work

Class work is split into the different years with the different assignment that I am able to get my
hands on. I plan to add the code in this section and depending on my schedule, will perhaps make a
YouTube video on the assignment.

## exam_papers

Past exams that I have worked through will be found in this section of the repo.

# Requests

If you have any old assignments and or material from class/school, I'd appreciate if you are able to
send them to `matoost13@gmail.com`. This will help with the material that I will be able to share.
